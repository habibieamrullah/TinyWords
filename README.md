Tiny Words Desktop Simple HTML Text Editor based on TinyMCE

This is an HTML file editor for reading and writing simple HTML text files.

You can write anything and save the document as HTML file ðŸ˜€

So it is a text editor based on the popular TinyMCE and because I made it as Desktop program so you can locate any file to edit the HTML content and you can save your edited texts as HTML files too.

You can download this program from my GoogleDrive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YMPukwP4LgGrLtftO-edBOVBSbJbmH5X/view?usp=sharing

Extract the content and find the executable file in it.
